INTRODUCTION
The Alternative Medicine is as old as human race itself. It is the most intriguing, fascinating and enthralling phenomena in the history of medicine. Although these authentic alternative medical sciences has been dismissed as a faddish when accessed by a fringe minority. It was founded on a sound principle and philosophy, tried and tested and had assumed an international legendary for curing the incurable diseases, radically, in all their ramifications, with no side effect or health hazard.
About ten years ago, the Royal Society of medicine wherein practitioner of orthodox and alternative medicine sat down together in an attempt to discover common ground. These meetings provided a landmark occasion which helped to destroy the stereotype image that each branch held of the other. Thus says, we on the orthodox wing recognized that our opponents were not quacks and charlatans, but sincere good people, deeply compassionate, searching for the truth for the benefit of mankind. In return the other side of the house recognized that we were not a conspiracy of a self-serving establishment seeking to crush new ideas that happen to arise outside of our own ranks. Infact, and this should come as no surprise, we shared a common goal which was the offer of our best for the improvement of length and quality of life of our sick and frightened patients. 
The major demarcation between orthodox and alternative medicine is one of epistemology or the philosophical underpinning of our quest for knowledge. Definitely, that until the early years of this century, there was no clear boundary between mainstream and fringe medicine other than the social status, respectability and income of their proponent. However, with the development of 20th century scientific philosophy, unnoticed by the medical profession itself (with a few rare exceptions) orthodox medicine has drifted towards a deductive science whereas alternative medicine has remained in large part, an inductive science. 
One feels that alternative medicine is not clearly understood; it has been the Cinderella of medicine for so long. Medicine is at its very best when it incorporate the scientific methods and the art of heating. Alternative medicine embodies such a system. 
The world Health organization (WHO) recognizing the fact that no system of medicine is a panacea and that rational treatment consist not so much on curing or removing diseases, but on restoring maximum function and supporting the patient in making necessary life style changes requisite for maintaining this Thus, the practitioner fulfills an essential educative and preventive role, which is in keeping with an alternative view of nature. Many civilized countries steps have been taken to strengthen alternative legal position. Some countries have given federal and state support and have been reimbursed under National Health Service, Some Government has allocated funds for establishment and Research in alternative medicine and also accorded official recognition to this method of practice. 
In Nigeria it is time that this lowly hand -maiden should shed her cloak of humility that is the six sophisticated and highly complex system namely. Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy. Herbal medicine, Acupuncture and Chiropractic’s, which have gained an appreciable degree of patronage over the decades in many countries of the world and come out of her obscurity in Nigeria and boldly proclaim what good she can do to the Nigerians. Hence the establishment of schools and colleges with an approve syllabus for would be practitioners. Homoeopathy and other alternatives medicine and Allopathy have to supplement each other, they have to know the limit of their efficiency:, only by proper training and excellence upbringing with a standard curriculum coupled with co-operation can the ideal art of the future be. brought forth. 

The modern college of Homeopathy and alternative medicine was founded with the primary aim to offer a series of study course in Homeopathy and other alternative medical sciences with a standard and approved syllabus.
 The college operates under the faculty of Homoeopathic medicine guide of 1981. 
The college is a private one having no connection with any of a similar name and exists only on the resources of its own teaching, having no governmental grants or aids. As a private college we feel that this independence is essential for a freedom of teaching methods. The college is advance in both teaching and research in Homoeopathy, Naturopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractic Herbal medicine and Biochemistry. The material is the latest and continual progressive research will improve on material as research offers new venues of interest and results. The school has within its staff a number of senior and well-versed instructors and also a number of visiting professors and honourable members of the board of regents adding to a total knowledge not to be found in any other college or school of a similar nature. 


FOREWARD
Health Education in the world today has taken a turn for the better, more and more people are realizing that Health education paves the way for a better life, offers a helping hand to those who are sick.
This college was founded with the primary aim to offer a series of study course in Homoeopathic medical sciences and other Alternative medicine to people in any country of the world, whose sole motive and objective are to help the sick. In the process of helping the sick, people, invariably have gone the wrong way. They practitioners have sometimes worsened the cases for which they were about to treat. The sick man becomes the poorer for it. This is because healer were groped in the dark, of what should have been the best treatment for his patient. This error of omission and commission in the process of treatment has been so. From time immemorial, until the advent of Homoeopathic medicine, into the world of therapeutics, that the veil has been broken and the curtain raised, to find a recipe for the eradication and cure of the sick, radically, from its base, without let or cant and restore the health to its normalcy, without drudgery. This happy news of Homeopathic medicine curing the sick, in a gentle but bloodless manner, had assumed an astronomical proportion in the wider spectrum of the society, that the Homeopathic treatment is now a household word for the sick, and no wonder the emergence of Homeopathic colleges, Hospitals, Pharmacies and dispensaries all over the world. Moreover, the whole concentration of human being should be on health. No one would part with his health for rich; rather he can part with riches for health. That being the case, the provost with his Board of Regents, have schemed out a plan and comprehensive curriculum, based on the years of research and training, to established a college of Rational therapy, which will train Nurses/Doctors specifically in this field to cater for the health care delivery of the suffering humanity. 
Dr. Caleb C. Colton 1780- 1832 had this to say, :there is this difference between the two temporal blessings health and money; money is the most envied, but the least enjoyed, health is the most enjoyed, but the least envied and this superiority of the latter is still more obvious, when we reflect that the poorest man would not part with heath for money, but that the richest would gladly part with all money for health". I have mounted this venture, since my brief sojourn on earth was marked by the vision of greater tomorrow for mankind and I was intuitionally subjected by infinite guidance to dedicate my life to the sick, and this I have done since my childhood, in order to live up to the aspiration and counsel of God my maker. It is with pleasure, that , this curriculum is presented to you after carefully studies that it will widen your mental horizon in this field of medical therapeutics, and we hope that it will be the means of bringing a new career within your grasp of course, this is only the introduction to a career that will demand your full endeavour and determination, and we hope you will accept the challenge.

It was dedicated to the teaching of classical and modern Homoeopathy as well as other forms of Alternative medicine with the expertise of qualified expatriates. For imparting the medical philosophy of Dr. Samuel Christian Frederick Hahnemann, the founder of Homoeopathy with accuracy and vigor, he consolidated the existence of this college till the period of major reforms. Indeed, he is honoured as the major epochal figure in the history of the practice of homoeopathic medicine in Nigeria. 
As he practiced and disseminated with powerful authority the principles of Homoeopathy and Natural therapeutics, the entire Nigerians graciously gave him the title of "Founder and Father of Homoeopathic medicine in Nigeria. through this singular effort of dedicated teaching which he started in 1940 in collaboration and affiliation with colleges and Universities abroad for which he collected correspondence courses and certificates from these institution to graduands, a lot of people benefited, and he used pioneer graduates to form the first Association of Nigerian Homoeopathic and Natural Therapeutics Association in 1965 with registration No. 130384. 
In 1982 as a founding father left behind an authentic guideline on the original teaching methods of homoeopathy and other forms of alternative medicine to continue on the original teaching method laid down by him as contained in the college curriculum.

The alternative medical nursing and midwifery shares in common the Conventional Philosophy of Nursing and a broad objectives of the programme and teaching methods in Nursing. It also consists of a series of therapeutic assumptions which are entirely opposed to the basic tenets of allopathic medicine. 
This curriculum is a model of it own that contains the abstract frame works, linking facts and phenomena, that assist nurses to plan Nursing care, investigate problems related to clinical practice, and study the outcomes of Nursing actions and interventions. The curriculums also deal deeply into nursing process that is, an individualized problem solving approach to the Nursing Care of patients. This involves four stages, Assessment of the patients problems, planning, implementation and evaluation. 
An alternative Nurse is a person who has completed a programme of basic alternative Nursing education and is qualified and authorized to practice nursing in this country and in anywhere in the world and duly registered with the alternative Nursing and midwifery council, that is, the registering statutory body that will be responsible for the regulation of these profession in the interest of the public.

This will widen the Nurses mental horizon and their versatility in caring for the sick.


GUIDELINE TO MODERN COLLEGE OF HOMOEOPATHY AND OTHER FORMS OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE UYO AKWA IBOM STATE 

Medical profession is a profession with a difference. Throughout history and from time immemorial, medical men were the special endowment of Divine talents and inspirations. They were regarded as Nobles and finer breeds up till today, the medical men, of whatever ramifications are still being looked upon with awe. The command respect wherever they go, because of the Nature of their duty to mankind. They are simply thought of, as having ready answers to human problems, and their ills. This is evident, when a patient is consulting a doctor for medical examination. After the examination, even when he or she is yet to be treated, the patient will have the feeling of wellbeing. He believes that the Doctor being what he is, has deepened his scientific insight into his human nature and has had a ready answer to his complaints, which he will proffer to his credit. 
Definitely, this feeling will continue to hold sway among the patient community, as long as the medical service exists. This high esteem for the Doctors and what they can do make them tick, a rare species of humanity. But not everybody is gifted to be a Doctor. 
Medical profession has a Divine concept, those who find themselves in the profession, had the Divine call to the field to do this humanitarian job. They were selected and sent into the world, to be the replica of God on earth to carry out the Divine aspiration for the services of mankind, to relieve mankind of their sufferings and Woes brought about by the disease. 
Medicine has different systems and concomitant therapies. But the two prominent scientific medicines which metamorphose into the world of medicine are. 
1.Allopathic medicine, otherwise known as the orthodox medicine, the old school.
2.Non-Allopathic medicine, known as the Homoeopathic medicine.
These two systems of medicine come into the forefront in the medical scheme of things; they both operate side by side with each other, and have as their set objective the dedication to the service of the suffering humanity. In other words, they are out to serve the sick. That is why, inspite of their different philosophies and principles, they and like twin brothers, wouldn't like to go it solo, for both have their knowledge to share. They are complementary to each other, in their march towards achieving radiant health for all by the year 2000. 
And not only has this, but to tackle with all the forces at their disposal, that dreadful monster the disease, which has reduced the human being to shambled, with its devastating blow. The modern college of Homoeopathy and alternative medicine limited, is operating within the framework of the all Nigerian Homoeopathic medical Association, the founding father, of all Homoeopathic medical -Association of Nigeria, the corporate body established by law and registered. 
The, modern college of Homoeopathy and other forms of alternative medicine Uyo Akwa Ibom State, like any of its kind all over the world, is an institution poised with the training of scientific medical Doctors in Homoeopathy and other alternative medicine with a repertoire of technical analytical, diagnostic, scientific, medical and pharmaceutical knowledge capable of withstanding challenges in the emerging trend in the medical profession, equally to train persons who will be highly competent, ethically and professionally sound, who will passed through the rigors of academic exactitude. 
Homoeopathy is a peculiar science, its principle, tents and philosophy are based on an immutable laws of cure. 
We trust that, the students enrolling in the college will join the ever growing roll of graduates, many of whom are ranked among the best Doctors in Nigeria. 
It is pride to serve in the capacity of those who are out to play the role of their brother's keepers, by helping the sick; it is a pride to become a medical Doctor in the annal of one's history. 
Good name is a pride to own and you can be justly proud, when you find yourself in no less a medical practice, then in the rank and file of Homoeo - medical therapeutic as offered in this great institution, which today so many doctors from other schools are desirous of crossing.
Alternative medical therapeutics presents a definite concrete and understandable approach to the problems of disease treatment.
Therefore, there is no gain saying the fact that, the physician educated in Homoeopathy and other alternative medical sciences offered here, has a wider outlook and incomparably larger armamentarium, with more precise weapons, than one not so educated. 
The college is an autonomous institution. The award is based on the Recognized medical qualification in Homoeopathy and other Alternative medicine as outline in the terms of enrolment.
